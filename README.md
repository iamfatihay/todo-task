# Project: Todo List Application Task

**Objective:**

Develop a Todo List application using Python without the use of a web framework (ideally). This application will emphasize basic task management with a due date to complete. The purpose of this assignment is to evaluate the overall understanding of the process and critical thinking process of the application.

## Requirements:
- User should be able to add ToDo items.
- Each item should have a due date assigned.
- User should be able to group related tasks.
- User has the ability to update and (soft) delete tasks.

Please implement the small application in your preferred language, ideally without any framework. Implement the basic REST API for the backend and consume it on the frontend.

## Evaluation Criteria

- Completeness of the assignment: The extent to which the specified requirements are implemented.
- Correctness of the overall application: The application should function as expected and without errors.
Evaluation Criteria:
- Understanding of the web security, database managament, coding best practices.

## Submission

- The source code for the application (ideally fork this repo).
- A README file that explains how to run and test the application.
- Bonus points will be awarded for the use of containers (e.g., Docker) to facilitate deployment and testing.
